## Employee Tracker

## Welcome to the Employee Tracker application

The employee tracker application was created for business owners to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company. This being said, the employee tracker application has all the necessary functions for business owners to plan and organize their business! When the application is started, the following options are presented: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role. When the option "view all departments" is chosen, then there is a formatted table showing department names and department ids. When "view all roles" is chosen, then the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role is presented. When "view all employees" is chosen, then a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to is presented. When "add a department" is chosen, then the option to enter the name of the department is presented and that department is added to the database. Furthermore, there is an option to "add a role" and once that is chosen, there is a prompt to enter the name, salary, and department for the role. When "add an employee" is chosen, then a prompt to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager is presented. Lastly, the option to "update an employee" is presented and then there is a prompt to select an employee to update and their new role. The information provided is updated in the database which makes this an extremely unique and useful application for all business owners everywhere!
